# Lab Instructions

This is where we left off in the previous activity. In this lesson, we'll upgrade our code to ensure that it looks as good as it can!

1. Use the code from the UI.
2. Paste it into V0 and generate a new UI per your instructions
3. Test that it is working as expected with `npm run dev`.
